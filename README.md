# QuickNPR

## Traditional NPR Challenges:
- Achieving expressive non-photorealistic rendering often relies on complex algorithms and extensive manual tuning.
- Computationally expensive, limiting real-time applications.
## Gaussian Splatting
- A lightweight, real-time rendering approach using Gaussian primitives.
- Limited exploration in artistic and NPR-style rendering contexts.
## Problem Statement:
How can Gaussian splatting be adapted and enhanced to achieve high-quality non-photorealistic effects while maintaining real-time performance?

The main feature we implement is the ability to **paint over Gaussians**. <br>Applying artistic textures and brushstroke effects by manipulating Gaussian attributes (e.g., color, transparency, and orientation).
